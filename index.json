The GEM-m potential is $\\phi(r)=\\exp(-r^m)$, where $r$ is the pair separation and $m$ is an adjustable exponent. A simple analytic formula for the fluid-solid envelope of the Gaussian Core Model (GCM) which takes account of the known low and high density limiting forms is proposed and shown to represent the simulation data well. The BIP potential is $\\phi(r) = 1/(a^q+r^q)^n/q$, where $a$, $n$, and $q$ are positive constants. The BIP potential Multiple Occupancy Crystal (MOC) or cluster crystals are predicted to form when $q2$ and $a0$, for $n3$, which compares with the corresponding GEM-m condition of $m2$. Reentrant melting should occur for the BIP potential when $q \\leq 2$ and $a0$. MD simulations in which the system was gradually compressed at constant temperature using the BIP potential produced cluster states in the parameter domain expected but it was not possible to establish conclusively whether a multiply occupied crystal or a cluster fluid had formed owing to assembly structural fluctuations. The Random Phase Approximation reproduces very well the BIP MD energy per particle without any discontinuities at the phase boundaries. The Lindemann Melting Rule (LMR) is shown analytically to give a more rapidly decaying reentrant melting curve boundary than the so-called Melting Indicator (MI) empirical melting criterion which has also been investigated in this study. The MI model gives a better match to the high density phase boundary for small $m$ and $q$ values.","tags":[],"title":"Reentrant melting and multiple occupancy crystals of bounded potentials: Simple theory and direct observation by molecular dynamics simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ioannis Nikiteas","Steven Dargaville","Paul N Smith","Richard P Smedley-stevenson","Christopher C.

Load balancing on highly refined angular meshes resulted into a reduction in the runtime of approximately 50% on a local machine. The time spent load balancing was found to be proportional to the number of unknowns of the problem, with the rate of the proportionality being dependant on the number of processing cores used. Strong scaling performance of 97% was achieved in 240 cores, dropping to 50% for 480 cores, for a mesh of 405,000 triangular elements. The ratio of nodes to halos indicates that as we adaptively refine, the load balancing algorithm produces an increasing number of partitions with fewer nodes and larger halos. Hence, destroying parallel scaling by performing communications instead of a solving the linear system.","tags":["Angular adaptivity","HPC","Neutronics"],"title":"Impact of load balancing on parallel performance with Haar wavelets angular adaptivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ioannis Nikiteas","David M.

If $T$ is the temperature and $\\\\rho$ is the number density of particles, two state points are isomorphic if a reference state, $\\\\rho_{0}$, $T_0$, $a_0$ and another state, $\\\\rho$, $T$, a are related through the relationships $\\\\rho^{n/3} / T = \\\\rho^{n/3}_{0} T_{0}$ and $a = a_{0} (\\\\rho_{0} / \\\\rho)^{1/3} = a_{0} (T_{0} / T)^{1/n}$. The potential form is therefore density dependent along an isomorph. Molecular dynamics simulations and solutions of the Ornstein-Zernike integral equation for $q = 2$ demonstrate the existence of isosbestic points (IBPs) in the radial distribution function and structure factor for 6 $\\\\leq$ n $\\\\leq$ 18 and a wide range of a and $\\\\rho$ values. For the BIP potentials with not too small a values and over a wide density range, the IBP distance is insensitive to the number density and is equal to the distance, $r_T$ , defined through $\\\\phi(r_T) = T$. For exponential potentials of the general form, $\\\\phi(r) = C \\\\exp(−r^{m})$ with $1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq 3$, there are also IBPs which are at $r$ values that are typically ∼10-15% larger than predicted by the formula for $r_T$.
